A command-line utility that recursively traverses directories and searches for files by name.

Build the binary using cargo:
cargo build

or build and subsequently run it:
cargo run

I suggest moving the executable to a directory in your PATH environment variable in order for you to use it more conveniently.

For information on usage and available options, run the application with the --help flag.
